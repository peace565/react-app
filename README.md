Branch develop2.0 is our development branch. To work on any project, checkout from branch develop2.0 to a new branch

- Step 6: Push the work to GitHub

### DO NOT!

1. Merge your pull requests with any branch, only the team lead and I (Chimere) will merge the branches
2. Do not ever push to develop, do not push to develop2.0, only push to your branch
3. Touch or edit anybody's code unless the person knows about it to avoid conflicts.
